## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL GAPS

- Rebuild authentication hierarchy:
  - Super Admin (Softwarevala) → manages platform
  - Institution Admin → manages their institution
  - Branch Admin → manages their branch
  - Other roles → scoped to institution
- Row-level security on all queries
- Separate database connections per institution OR shared DB with tenant isolation

## ARCHITECTURAL DEBT SUMMARY

### 🔴 **DATABASE ARCHITECTURE ISSUES**

**Problem 1: Single-Tenant Design**
```sql
-- CURRENT (Wrong):
CREATE TABLE students (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  -- No institution_id!
);

-- NEEDED:
CREATE TABLE students (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  institution_id TEXT REFERENCES institutions(id),  -- CRITICAL
  name TEXT,
  -- ALL queries must filter by institution_id
);
```

**Problem 2: No Tenant Isolation**
- 85+ tables ALL need `institution_id`
- All queries need institution filtering
- No RLS (Row Level Security) policies

**Problem 3: No Institution Management**
- Missing `institutions` table as parent entity
- Current `branches` table assumes single institution
- No institution-level settings
- No institution administrators

---

### 🔴 **AUTHENTICATION ARCHITECTURE ISSUES**

**Current Hierarchy:**
```
Super Admin
  ├── School Admin    } All manage SAME institution
  ├── Teacher
  └── Parent
```

**Required Hierarchy:**
```
Platform Super Admin (Softwarevala Liberia)
  ├── Institution 1
  │   ├── Institution Admin
  │   ├── Branch 1
  │   │   ├── Branch Admin
  │   │   ├── Teachers
  │   │   └── Staff
  │   └── Branch 2
  └── Institution 2
      └── Single Campus
```

---

### 🔴 **SECURITY ISSUES**

**Current:**
- No tenant isolation in queries
- User from School A can potentially see School B data
- No institution-scoped permissions
- No API tenant validation

**Required:**
- Every query must include `WHERE institution_id = ?`
- Middleware to inject institution context
- Database views per institution
- API key per institution
- Audit log per institution

## ESTIMATED EFFORT

**To reach production-ready multi-tenant SaaS:**

| Phase | Duration | Effort |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Phase 1: Critical Fixes | 6-7 weeks | 🔴 **Critical** |
| Phase 2: High Priority | 6 weeks | 🟡 **High** |
| Phase 3: Medium Priority | 7-8 weeks | 🟢 **Medium** |
| Phase 4: Production | 4 weeks | 🔵 **Ongoing** |
| **TOTAL** | **23-25 weeks** | **~6 months** |

**Current State:** 52% complete for single-school  
**Target State:** 100% complete for multi-school SaaS  
**Gap:** ~48% + architectural refactoring

---

## CONCLUSION

### What Works Well ✅
- Core student/teacher/academic structure
- Examination & results system
- Basic HR & payroll
- Basic communication framework
- TypeScript implementation
- Offline-first database approach

### Critical Gaps 🔴
1. **No multi-tenant architecture** (show-stopper)
2. **No admission workflow** (core feature missing)
3. **No proper accounting system** (critical for schools)
4. **Incomplete reception module** (front-desk essential)
5. **No backup/restore** (data safety critical)
6. **No production deployment setup** (can't deploy)

### Decision Required ❓

**Option A:** Major refactor (add multi-tenancy to existing 85+ tables)  
**Option B:** Fresh build with correct architecture  
**Option C:** Hybrid (keep modules, rebuild foundation)

**Recommended:** Option C - Rebuild foundation (multi-tenancy, auth, accounting), keep and refactor existing modules.

**Next Steps:** Await your decision on approach before proceeding with Phase 1 critical fixes.
